# Design-Thinking-Project : MindAnchor
**Course:** Technology and Information System (SECP1513)

**Group:** 7

## 🧠 Project Overview
MindAncor is a Design Thinking Project to help ADHD students to stay focus and restlessness during learning and studying. 
It is a mobile application connected with a physical Focus Regulation tool via Blueetooth and without using tracking system or performance pressure. 
The Design Thinking process is applied which are Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, which make sure the solution is user-centred and practical.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Some research showed that ADHD students easily have difficulty paying attention due to restlessness, distraction and making decisions.
Many available productivity applications required tracking and self-discipline, which will cause ADHD users to feel stressed and reduce long-term usability.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
MindAnchor provides:
- A physical Focus Regulatioon tool that turning fidgeting into calming and useful actions.
- A mobile application that recommend focus strategies based on simple screening questions.
- Guided focus sessions for users
- Parents-guided mode for students below 10 years old.
This can help ADHD student to reduce cognitive load and supports emotion regulation during learning and studying.

## My Role in the Project
**Prototype Designer** 
- Designed MindAnchor app screen interfaces
- Designed physical Focus Regulation tool 
- Improved interface flow and usability from team discussion and testing feedback

## 🧪 Design Thinking Evidence
This repository includes:
- Project report
- MindAnchor Mobile Application Prototype

## Reflection
Through this Design Thinking Project, I learned that emphatise phase is extremely important by understanding users' emotions, behaviours and the daily challenges faced by them. 
So that, a useful solutions can be designed for ADHD users. Besides, I also realised that simple, calm and user-centred designs is more effective than complex systems.  
By designing the prototype screens and physical Focus Regulation Tool, I gained experience in translating the ideas into practical prototype.
I also understood the importance of interface flow, simple visuality and tactile interaction can help users to manage focus and emotion. 
This project strengthened my problem-solving skills, teamwork and communication. Thus, this project improved my design thinking mindset and prepared me to develop more
useful and user-friendly digital solutions in the future.
